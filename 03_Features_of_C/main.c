    /*
        Some features of C
            1. It's a high level programming language.
                You just have to write code, not binary.
                We don't have to worry about CPU low level stuff directly.
            2. It's a small language
                Just 32 keywords
            3. It's a core language of many other languages.
            4. It's portable.
                Write once, compile everywhere with some modifications if needed.
            5. Builtin functions.
                We can use them.
            6. It's a structured language and moduler.
                We can arrange the code in very structured manner.
            7. It supports the use of Pointers.
                Direct RAM stuff.
            8. Extensive Language.
                We can add our own functions to C Library.
            9. Super FAST.
            10. Dynammic Memory Allocation.
                We can use dynamic memory (HEAP).
            11. It's case sensitive.
            12. It's use for Embedded System programming.
