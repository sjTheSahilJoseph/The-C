    // Program
    // A program is a set of instructions which we give to the computer to perform a specific task.
    
    // System Program - Program for System Specific Tasks
    //  For Example [Operating System, File Explorer, Terminal]

    // Application Program - Program for Ourself
    //  For Example [Browser, Game, Text Editor]

    // The Language
    // Computer works on Binary, but we can't write programs by writting binary by ourself, It will be quite tedious and time taking thing.
    // That's why we use a programming language.
    // When we write a program using a programming language, later on, when we execute the executable, It'll be converted into Binary.
    // So we solved both problems, one is writing programs, second, a way to write program.
    
    // C
    // Developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.
    // Standardized by ANSI in 1989.

    // We will write our program in C.
    // The compiler of C will generate an executable file.
    // Executable file is binary file.
    // Which we can run.

    // Extension
    // The extension of C program is ".c".
